# CS-521-Final-Project
Simple upload file using python to test user input

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the how data can be handled and displayed while testing for user input. Data is everywhere. Knowing how to extract it and use it can be beneficial for finding insights. We begin by extracting the data in listings.csv and pulling the data within that csv file onto the python main file. Using the data we extract from the csv file, we define the parameters of the list which is name, ticker, and price set in stock.py. The simple usage of this code information allows the user to retrieve this information as a reference while testing valid inputs and/or looping them to enter valid inputs. The output of the code begins by asking the user if they want to see the info with a simple ‘y’ for yes or ‘n’ for no. If y, the user will view the information. If n, the user will exit. If the user where to continue to view the listing, it will be prompted to end the program.

Instructions
After unzipping the jemart12@bu.edu_term_project.zip, please ensure you save all the files where your main directory is. Once saved, all files will be used and the main file will run extracting the stock.py class object and the data in the list.csv.
